### Error Handling and logging

- [ ] Do not disclose sensitive information in error responses, including system details, session identifiers
or account information
- [ ] Use error handlers that do not display debugging or stack trace information
- [ ] Implement generic error messages and use custom error pages
- [ ] The application should handle application errors and not rely on the server configuration
- [ ] Properly free allocated memory when error conditions occur
- [ ] Error handling logic associated with security controls should deny access by default
- [ ] All logging controls should be implemented on a trusted system (e.g., The server)
- [ ] Logging controls should support both success and failure of specified security events
- [ ] Restrict access to logs to only authorized individuals
- [ ] Log all input validation failures
- [ ] Log all authentication attempts, especially failures
- [ ] Log all access control failures
- [ ] Log all system exceptions
- [ ] Log all backend TLS connection failures
- [ ] Log cryptographic module failures
