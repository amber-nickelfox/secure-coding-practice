# General Practices


- [ ] Use tested and approved managed code rather than creating new unmanaged code for common tasks
- [ ] Do not pass user supplied data to any dynamic execution function
- [ ] Review all secondary applications, third party code and libraries to determine business necessity and
validate safe functionality, as these can introduce new vulnerabilities
- [ ] Clearly define roles and responsibilities
- [ ] Implement a secure software development lifecycle
- [ ] Build a re-usable object library
