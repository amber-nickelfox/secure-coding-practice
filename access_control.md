# Access Control



- [ ] Use only trusted system objects, e.g. server side session objects, for making access authorization
decisions
- [ ] Access controls should fail securely
- [ ] Deny all access if the application cannot access its security configuration information
- [ ] Enforce authorization controls on every request, including those made by server side scripts,
"includes" and requests from rich client-side technologies like AJAX
- [ ] Restrict access to protected URLs to only authorized users
- [ ] Restrict access to protected functions to only authorized users
- [ ] Restrict direct object references to only authorized users
- [ ] Restrict access to services to only authorized users
- [ ] Restrict access to application data to only authorized users
- [ ] Restrict access security-relevant configuration information to only authorized users
- [ ] Enforce application logic flows to comply with business rules
- [ ] Create an Access Control Policy to document an application's business rules, data types and access
authorization criteria and/or processes so that access can be properly provisioned and controlled
