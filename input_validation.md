### Input Validations

- [ ] Conduct all the validation on the trusted system (Ex: The server)
- [ ] There should be centralized input validation for an application
- [ ] All validation failures should result in input rejection
- [ ] Validate all client provided data before processing, including all parameter
- [ ] Verify all header values in both request and response
- [ ] Validation for expected data type, data range, data length
- [ ] Validate all input against a "white" list of allowed characters, whenever possible
- [ ] Specify proper character sets, such as UTF-8, for all sources of input
